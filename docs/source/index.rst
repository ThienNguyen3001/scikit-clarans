scikit-clarans Documentation
============================

Welcome to the documentation for **scikit-clarans**, a specialized clustering library for Python.

**scikit-clarans** brings the power of the CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search) algorithm to the **scikit-learn** ecosystem. It is designed to be:

*   **Efficient**: Optimized for larger datasets where standard k-medoids might struggle.
*   **Compatible**: A drop-in replacement for scikit-learn clusterers efficiently implementing `fit`, `predict`, and more.
*   **Flexible**: Supports customizable initialization strategies and distance metrics.
