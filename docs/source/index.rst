scikit-clarans Documentation
============================

**scikit-clarans** is a Python library that provides a scikit-learn compatible implementation of the CLARANS (Clustering Large Applications based on RANdomized Search) algorithm.

CLARANS is designed to be more efficient than PAM (k-medoids) for large datasets by employing randomized search strategies within the graph of possible medoid sets.
